# If the number is divisible by 3, print "is a Fizz number."
# If the number is divisible by 5, print "is a Buzz number."
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "is a FizzBuzz number."
# Otherwise, print "is neither a fizzy or a buzzy number."

Enter "0" at anytime to quit.
Enter whole numbers other than 0 to determine a number's Fizzyness or Buzzyness.
Decimals and Fractions are always FizzBuzz.
